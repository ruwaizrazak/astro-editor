title: 'When Figma Starts Designing Us'

> However, over the course of the last five years, I’ve grown increasingly worried about what Figma is doing to the field of design by pushing designers toward an engineering-centric way of working. This can be seen in their feature releases: Smart Components, Variables, Auto Layout, and Interactive Prototypes. These features are often celebrated as steps toward parity with engineering, but in practice, they encourage a mode of working that narrows the field of possibility at precisely the moment when it should be expanding.

As an engineer, I agree wholeheartedly with this. The design systems nerd in me absolutely loves these engineering-focused features in Figma. But if we go too far down this road, designers will bring less and less creative value to teams over time.
